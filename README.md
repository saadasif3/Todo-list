# Todo-list
This API is written as assignment by Saad Asif, alumni of Univercity of Central Punjab, Gujranwala, Pakistan.
There might some flaws in the code and might not run on every system due to deficiency of files needed to run the code. Here's the summary of this assignment what I have learned, the steps I followed, and the outcome.

Summary of Todo list API Development  

Key Learnings:
1- Developed a foundational understanding of Express.js for building APIs.
2- Implemented CRUD operations for managing tasks.
3- Utilized an in-memory array for temporary data storage.
4- Applied middleware (`express.json()`) for handling JSON requests.
5- Identified areas for improvement, including error handling and data persistence.

Development Process:
1. Initialized Express.js to create the backend server.
2. Set up routing for adding, retrieving, and deleting tasks.
3. Managed task IDs dynamically with an incremental counter.
4. Tested API responses to verify correctness and functionality.
5. Reviewed enhancements, such as validation improvements and database integration.

Final Outcome
- Built a functional task management API with dynamic operations.
- Improved error handling for better reliability.
- Established a scalable foundation for future expansion, including MongoDB integration.
